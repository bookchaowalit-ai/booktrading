## Dashboard UI (Observe-Only)

The frontend has **5 main pages** as the single source of truth for observing the system. All are observe-only — no Start/Trade/Configure/Reset buttons in the main UX.

| Page | Answers | Key Data |
|------|---------|----------|
| **Today** | What to do now? | Decision, kill switch, capital, next triggers |
| **Evidence** | What happened? | Timeline, gates, paper positions, activity feed |
| **Research** | What's worth watching? | Crypto candidates, Polymarket reviews, intelligence |
| **System** | Is everything healthy? | Component health, risk sources, grid/bot status |
| **Daily Report** | Operational snapshot? | Trade journal, daily PnL, system overview |

**Frontend route consolidation** (Batch 1+2 extraction) is complete. 38 routes have been categorised: 5 keep-main, 14 extracted-to-component, 8 advanced-only, 11 hidden/deferred. The 5 main pages above will NOT gain new action buttons — all future feature extractions go into components or Advanced UI only.

## System State Snapshot

| Metric                | Value         |
|-----------------------|---------------|
| Kill switch           | **ACTIVE**    |
| Kill reason           | Paper-bot max drawdown 15.84% (limit 5%) |
| Bankroll              | $84.54 paper bankroll |
| Peak bankroll         | $100.45       |
| Active positions      | 14 (legacy)   |
| Resolved positions    | 6             |
| Max positions allowed | 8             |
| Daily loss limit      | $5            |
| Consecutive loss limit| 3             |

## Risk Sources

There are two separate risk systems. Do not mix them when making readiness decisions.

| Source | Scope | Used For |
|--------|-------|----------|
| `paper_bot` | Polymarket / paper-capital state | Kill switch, paper drawdown, active positions, readiness gates |
| `risk_manager` / grid bot | BTCTHB grid state | Grid health, grid drawdown, grid daily limits |

`/api/command-center` is the dashboard source of truth and should use `paper_bot` as the effective kill-switch source while the system is in capital-protection mode.

## Daily Monitor Command

```bash
cd domains/product/engineering/book-dev/github/bookchaowalit-ai/book-products/booktrading
docker compose exec strategy python scripts/monitor.py
```

Expected output includes:
- Active / resolved position counts
- Bankroll, PnL, drawdown %
- Kill switch status + reason
- Consecutive losses, daily PnL
- Per-signal PnL breakdown
- Decision recommendation

## Decision Tree

```
START
  │
  ├─ Kill switch ACTIVE? ──────────► WAIT
  │                                   └─ Do nothing. Log the state.
  │
  ├─ Active positions > 8? ────────► WAIT
  │                                   └─ Legacy positions need to resolve.
  │                                      Check back daily.
  │
  ├─ Resolved trades < 50%? ───────► WAIT
  │                                   └─ Not enough data to evaluate signals.
  │
  ├─ Per-signal PnL available? ────► REVIEW_SIGNALS
  │                                   └─ Identify worst performers.
  │                                      Disable signals with consistent losses.
  │
  ├─ Signal PnL reviewed,          ► ENABLE_DRY_RUN
  │  positions ≤ 8?
  │                                   └─ Set POLY_DRY_RUN=true
  │                                      Run for 2-4 weeks. Log would-trade entries.
  │
  ├─ Dry-run stable 2-4 weeks? ───► RESET_PAPER
  │                                   └─ Reset paper state. Start fresh paper cycle.
  │
  └─ Paper stable 2-4 weeks        ► MICRO-LIVE (see prerequisites below)
     + all prerequisites met?

## When NOT to Reset Kill Switch

**Do NOT reset the kill switch if ANY of these are true:**

1. Active positions still > 8 (legacy positions unresolved)
2. You haven't reviewed per-signal PnL for all signal types
3. Dry-run mode hasn't been run for at least 2 weeks
4. Bankroll drawdown cause hasn't been identified
5. You're doing it "just to see what happens"

**The kill switch is working correctly.** It stopped trading at 15.84% paper-bot drawdown — that's the system doing its job. Resetting without evidence is how money is lost.

---

## When to Enable POLY_DRY_RUN=true

Only after ALL of these are met:

- [ ] Kill switch has been reset
- [ ] Active positions ≤ 8
- [ ] Per-signal PnL reviewed — worst signals disabled
- [ ] Market blocklist confirmed: `politics,sports,entertainment,celebrities`
- [ ] You're ready to log would-trade entries daily for 2-4 weeks

Enable with:
```bash
# In .env
POLY_DRY_RUN=true
```

---

## When to Disable Losing Signals

When resolved trades have PnL data:

1. Run monitor — check per-signal PnL breakdown
2. Any signal type with **net PnL < -$5** → disable before any reset/dry-run
3. Add it to `POLY_DISABLED_SIGNALS` or the default disabled signal list
4. Re-run dry-run mode to validate improvement

Current evidence: `momentum` is disabled by default after -$10.93 PnL over 4 resolved trades with 0% win rate.

---

## Micro-Live Prerequisites

**Real money trading is FORBIDDEN until ALL are satisfied:**

- [ ] Dry-run mode stable for **2-4 weeks** with positive expected value
- [ ] Per-signal PnL shows at least 3 signal types profitable
- [ ] Max drawdown in dry-run < 5%
- [ ] Win rate > 52% over 50+ would-trade entries
- [ ] Market blocklist filtering confirmed working
- [ ] Kill switch tested and confirmed responsive
- [ ] Starting capital is money you can 100% afford to lose

Even then: start with **minimum position sizes** ($1-2 per trade).

## Emergency Stop & Reset Procedure

### Emergency Stop (halt everything NOW)

```bash
# Stop the bot container
docker compose stop strategy

# Or set kill switch manually via Redis
docker compose exec redis redis-cli SET poly_paper:kill_override 1
```

### Reset Kill Switch (ONLY when decision tree says GO)

```bash
# 1. Verify conditions are met (run monitor first)
docker compose exec strategy python scripts/monitor.py

# 2. If monitor says REVIEW_SIGNALS or better, reset via Python
docker compose exec strategy python -c "
from app.polymarket.paper_bot import PolymarketPaperBot
bot = PolymarketPaperBot()
bot.reset_kill_switch()
print('Kill switch reset. Monitor closely.')
"
```

### Full Paper Reset (nuclear option — clears all positions)

```bash
# ONLY after dry-run validation is complete
docker compose exec redis redis-cli DEL poly_paper:state
```

**WARNING:** This deletes all position history. Only do this when you're starting a completely fresh paper cycle after dry-run validation.

## Rules

1. **No real money** until micro-live prerequisites are all checked
2. **No kill switch reset** without evidence from per-signal PnL
3. **No architecture changes** while in capital protection mode
4. **Monitor daily** — even if nothing changed, log the state
5. **Small changes only** — tests, docs, config. No big refactors.
6. **Never set `POLY_DRY_RUN=false`** for real money until RUNBOOK micro-live prerequisites are met. See `.env.example` for safe-by-default config.
